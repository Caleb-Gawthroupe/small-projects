# small-projects
Small random projects to help advance my learning skills

Currently This includes:
Sigdigs -> A project I made while in grade 11 physics which will calculate the significant digits in a given number

pyCharge -> Combined the myNotify app on my iPhone with the task scheduler on windows to create a script that will remind me to plug in my laptop every night.

snake -> the classic snake game built in pygame. 

small game-> another random game to help me understand the pygame library.

coding warcrime -> my comp sci teacher made a program to teach functions, and I decided to accomplish the same thing in a one liner.
